# Graphite-Rust

  * Experiment that took on a life of it's own
  * Built to satisfy some needs at ViaSat, Inc.
   * Love graphite
   * Hate it's opaque performance problems
   * Troublesome installation
  * Supports a private cloud installation and large-ish logging/indexing cluster

Note: http://viasat.github.io/everything-is-logging

# We'll cover

 * Graphite concepts (run don't walk)
 * Analysis of graphite arch shortcomings (brisk walk)
 * Graphite's most popular implementation (run don't walk)
 * The Rust-Graphite implementation (leisurely strole)
 * Analysis of graphite-rust shortcomings (leisurely strole)

# Let's Talk Metrics

---

# Not

 * Analytics
   * Urchin/Google Analytics
 * Business Intelligence
   * Hadoop/Storm
 * High-level
   * Web session heatmaps
 * Aggregation
   * StatsD

---

# StatsD

Gets a lot of love in the re-implementation area.

Maybe graphite should too?

note: there's a go graphite database implementation which I found later

---

## Graphite metric concepts

 * Long-lived time series
 * Regular update intervals
 * Straight-forward naming
   * one-dimensional
   * ad-hoc
 * Great ecosystem of tools which can use it
   * Grafana 1 & 2
   * Seyren
   * CollectD for metric collection
   * sed/awk/nc dreamteam

---

## Graphite metric concepts

    ( Name, [(Timestamp, Value)] )

---

### Names

Metric names are primitive

<pre>
  proglangs.rust.community.active_members
  proglangs.rust.community.borrow_questions
  proglangs.go.community.active_members
  proglangs.go.community.segfault_questions
</pre>

---

### Names

Finding your metrics can get fancy

<pre>
  proglangs.*.community.active_members
</pre>

Yields

<pre>
  -> proglangs.rust.community.active_members
  -> proglangs.go.community.active_members
</pre>

---

#### Values

primitive like whoa

    (u32,f64)

---

### Values

u32: seconds since epoch. SECONDS

f64: a number, big or small or in between

---

### Values

what can you possibly store with that?

...

enough to be dangerous!

## Graphite in Python

Actually 3 core components, whose names I have adopted

  3. Graphite-Web
  2. Carbon
  1. Whisper

---

## Graphte in Python Installation

Tricky, many components

Run `sudo pip install` or learn the `virtualenv` toolchain

---

## 3. Graphite-Web

A multi-format web service written on top of Django.

 * Least interesting to me
 * Read-only access to database
 * HTML interface for rendering queries
 * REST-y interface
  * discovering metrics 
  * querying/transform and delivering
   * JSON, CSV, plaintext, pickle, etc
 * Tons of features, hidden gems

---

## 2. Carbon

A TCP/UDP daemon for recording datapoints

  * Moderately interesting to me
  * Creates metric storage if necessary
  * Writes metrics to disk
  * Handles the life-cycle of resources when writing

---

## 3. Whisper

  * Fascinating
  * Understands bytes on disk
  * Writes points
   * Through all archives
  * Should be easier than writing a ACID MVCC
    * Like, way easier
    * No real query planner
    * No multi-block joins
    * No transactions

note: should be simple enough, right? how hard can it be to write timestamps and points to disk?

---

### 3. Whisper

  ... Rust is fast. Maybe that'll make perf automaticly faster?

  Turned out to be true

---

## Digging in to Whisper

<pre><code data-trim>
pub trait WhisperFile {
    fn open(&amp;Path) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Error&gt;;
    fn new(path: &amp;Path, schema: Schema) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Error&gt;;
    fn write(&amp;mut self, current_time: u64, point: point::Point);
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code data-trim>
pub struct MutexWhisperFile {
    pub handle: Mutex&lt;File&gt;,
    pub header: Header
}
</code></pre>

note: I'm using some kind of cell to do a runtime mutable borrow

---

<pre><code data-trim>
// TODO: Don't think we need Copy/Clone.
// Just added it to make tests easier to write.
#[derive(PartialEq,Copy,Clone,Debug)]
pub struct ArchiveInfo {
    pub offset: SeekFrom,
    pub seconds_per_point: u64,
    pub points: u64,
    pub retention: u64,
}
</code></pre>

---

## Tuple Structs

Whisper constructs not present in Python

<pre><code data-trim>
// Index in to an archive, 0..points.len()
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
pub struct ArchiveIndex(pub u64);

// A normalized timestamp
pub struct BucketName(pub u64);
</code></pre>

note: expressive, zero-cost, safe

---

## Case Study: Wrap Around Read

Used in downsampling

  1. Example of "read" amplification
  1. I like "pure" code
  2. I was figuring out tangled python
  3. I wanted to reuse a buffer

---

## Case Study: Wrap Around Read For Downsampling

Type signatures are neat!

<pre><code data-trim>
pub fn read_ops<'a> (h_res_archive: &ArchiveInfo, 
                     l_res_archive: &ArchiveInfo,
                     h_res_points: &'a mut [point::Point],
                     point_timestamp: u64,
                     h_res_anchor: BucketName)
-> (
             (ArchiveIndex, &'a mut [point::Point]),
      Option<(ArchiveIndex, &'a mut [point::Point])>
   )
</code></pre>

Note: slightly weird code. experiment. prepares buffer for later read.

---

## Case Study: Wrap Around Read

Powered by a favorite: <code data-trim>split_at_mut</code>

<pre><code data-trim>
// Contiguous read. The easy one.
if h_res_start_index < h_res_end_index {
    ((h_res_start_index, &mut h_res_points[..]), None)
// Wrap-around read
} else {
    let split_index = (hres.points - start_index.0) as usize;
    let (first_buf, second_buf) = points.split_at_mut( split_index );
    let zero_index = ArchiveIndex(0);
    ((h_res_start_index, first_buf), Some((zero_index, second_buf)))
}
</code></pre>

---

## Is it faster?

 * Yes. Duh.
 * 2-3x faster.
  * Python: spends more time in userland
  * Rust: spends more time in syscalls
 * With the same naÃ¯ve behavior as python
   * Open file, read headers, close it right away

note: complicated history here. we were recording too many metrics at too high of a frequency. but apples to apples is good.

---

## Carbon

 Start of the WhisperCache

  * Hold files descriptors for longer
  * Still need eviction
  * Make re-use fast
  * Does period fsync
  

---

Handling lifetime issues is a normal task when writing Rust.

---

Let's run through an issue adding the "metric drilldown has children?" feature

---

Use <code data-trim>read_dir</code> to see if a directory has anything inside it

<pre><code data-trim>
read_dir( path_buf ).unwrap().any(|f| {
    let metadata = f.unwrap().metadata().unwrap();
    metadata.is_dir() || metadata.is_file()
})
</code></pre>

---

But oh no!

<code data-trim>read_dir( path_buf )</code> moved ownership of <code data-trim>path_buf</code> and broke later code.

---

What to do? `clone()` is easy. Just throw it in there.

<pre><code data-trim>
read_dir( path_buf.clone() ).unwrap().any(|f| {
    let metadata = f.unwrap().metadata().unwrap();
    metadata.is_dir() || metadata.is_file()
})
</code></pre>

---

# JK

I try to avoid <code data-trim>clone()</code>. It's more fun that way.

---

Code compiles but requires a "wasteful" memory copy

A closer ðŸ‘€

<pre><code data-trim>

pub fn read_dir&lt;P: AsRef&lt;Path&gt;&gt;(path: P) -> Result&lt;ReadDir&gt;

</code></pre>

---

What did Rust let me do that Python couldn't?

Play detective
